# Pig-game
I created this game by following a  course on Udemy

In this project:

1. I learnt the importance of writing comments in code, and I re-enforced this knowlegde by actually writing comments for each section of my code
2. Thsi project also helped me to improve my ability to implement programing logic
3. I also learnt the difference betwenn function call and function declaration. 
4. I also got to practice more on refactoring my code.
